# Finance Project 📊

This project focuses on financial data analysis and predictive modeling using Python and Machine Learning. It includes two main phases: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Model Development.

## 📂 Project Structure
## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Statistical insights & summary metrics
- Visualizations: distributions, correlations, and trends
- Feature engineering for modeling

## 🤖 Model Development
- Data splitting into train/test
- Feature scaling and transformation
- Machine Learning models implemented:
Regression / Classification models (depending on dataset target)
Model evaluation metrics (Accuracy, RMSE, R², etc.)
Hyperparameter tuning for optimization

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy → Data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn → Visualization
- Scikit-learn → Machine Learning

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/nikitansg/finance-project.git
   cd finance-project
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
